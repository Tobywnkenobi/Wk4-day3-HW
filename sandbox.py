Create Linked List 


I did try to go back through a couple of tutorials about doing this, and coded along with them.  I understand the concept of the single and double linked lists overall.  in the single list, you start at the beginning, and you check each node until you find the one that you are looking for.  It is not as effcient as the double length lists, although they require the most memory.  The concept of the double is that it splits in two directions from the head, and you can still traverse each node across them.  The key is to close the hole.  you can easily remove a node by skipping it, essentially deleting it.  You can also easily add nodes.  The problem for me is seeing where all of this play into the code.  I understand that this allows us to move through super large data sets, and some of the implicatons, but more of just seeing how it all functions on a deeper level.
